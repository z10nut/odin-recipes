        <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, 
                baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until 
                right before you cook the pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook 
                until both sides are brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
